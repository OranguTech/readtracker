  ReadTracker is a tool for keeping track of what and how you read your books.<br/><br/>
  Add the book you&rsquo;re currently reading to ReadTracker and start the timer every time you sit down to read.<br/><br/>
  After a while ReadTracker will be able to give you some insight into how you read and give a prediction on how long you have left.<br/><br/>
  When you&rsquo;ve completed the book you&rsquo;ll get a summary of your reading. And you can write a short note about what you thought of it that you can share with your friends, or just keep for your future self.<br/><br/>
