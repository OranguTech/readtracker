  <string name="sample_closing_remark">Not really sure I agree that this was better than the first one, but it was definitely as good. I was missing a real build up for the middle part though, and it kind of broke the pace of the story for me a little. But looking forward to reading the last one, hoping for a satisfying conclusion.</string>
